# Existing Work

---

# OpenStudio & Measures
* Integrated application suite, SDK, and API for parametric building energy modeling
* Model/API for building energy modeling
* Application, SketchUp plugin, Parametric Analysis Tool (PAT) 
* Ruby-based API for model generation, manipulation, and reporting
* [http://openstudio.net, https://unmethours.com/questions/]


# OpenStudio Analysis Framework
* Containerized OpenStudio instance (and many helper programs) for *large scale analysis* using OpenStudio and measures
* Spreadsheet-based problem generation, supporting advanced analysis problem generation and sampling (Morris method, LHS, et al.)
* [https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio-server, https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio-analysis-spreadsheet]

.left-column[
  ## Technology Evaluation
]
.right-column[
* Investigate energy savings and glare control potential via "climate sweep"

* Large scale analysis of the product prototype on multiple, exemplar, commercial building types and climate zones

* Use Radiance to calculate Dynamic Daylight Metrics and account for spatial, climate-based daylight distributions (DA/cDA/UDI)

* Compare energy savings and daylight metrics of study building models with and without product installed

## Meanwhile...
]
.right-column[
## Tedious Model Creation
* No automated way to add daylighting objects to models
* No ability to model shading controls (i.e., no dynamic windows)

## Limited output
* No daylight metrics

## Limited batch processing
* Radiance Implementation "glued on" to OS GUI:
![image](./img/radiance_radio.png)
* Batch processing only via command line
* .red[No Access] to Measures, PAT, Spreadsheet, OS-Server
  [this is lame]

## Measurification of the Radiance Workflow

###Oh man, it was super hard! Look:
```ruby
class RadianceMeasure < OpenStudio::Ruleset::ModelUserScript
```

* The OpenStudio API offers a macro* class for easy script generation within the OpenStudio application ecosystem

## Radiance Measure
Radiance simulation workflow can by applied via OpenStudio Application:

# New Radiance Functionality

---

##Support for dynamic windows in OpenStudio

Complex fenestration with bidirectional scatter distribution functions (BSDFs)
* Blinds
* Shadecloth
* Daylight Redirecting Devices

Dynamic glazings via multi-pass Radiance runs 
* Traditional Radiance materials .red[glass] and .red[trans] materials

###Proving ground for Radiance Measure
* Broke OpenStudio Server
  * Data merges overran available memory
* added silly hacks to git'er done, e.g.:
```ruby
  # check for number of rmtxop processes
  def merge_count()
      return `pgrep rmtxop`.split.size
  end
  ...
  while merge_count() > 2
      puts "waiting in rmtxop queue..."
      sleep(5)
  end
  rad_command = "dctimestep output/dc/#{wg}.vmx \
  annual-sky.mtx | rmtxop -fa -c 47.4 120 11.6 - \
  > output/ts/#{wg}.ill"
  exec_statement(rad_command, runner)
  ```
* Still broke server
  * Output overran available storage
* Ultimately had to reduce the parameter space
  * 1 building type (Small Office)
  * 16 climate zones
  * base case/lighting controls/shading controls (SmarterShade)

## Conclusions, Benefits, WhatHaveYou

.left-column[
## Benefits
]
.right-column[
## Wells Fargo IN2 Project
* Determined ideal use cases for product
* Verified pre-existing concerns WRT ultimate energy efficiency potential ¯\\__(ツ)__/¯

## NREL
* Vastly improved the Radiance integration within OpenStudio
* Added functionality
  * Works with other measures (e.g. in a parametric matrix)
  * PAT
  * OpenStudio Spreadsheet

## Conclusions
]
.right-column[
###"Just because you can, doesn't mean you should."

Running Radiance on an entire building, at a resolution to support complex fenestration devices AND dynamic daylight metrics, is intractible:
* Not enough time
* Not enough memory (RAM)
* Not enough storage

The "cloud" is of little help; it just masks the mountain.

.left-column[
## Next Steps
]
.right-column[

###Give users ability to:
* Tag spaces (or groups of spaces) for Radiance analysis
* Apply shade & lighting schedules from exemplar spaces to similar spaces

### Add new measures for:
* Simple reporting of static data
* Interractive data browsing and manipulation (e.g. sensor setpoint optimization)

### What Else?
* Many presentations this week have illustrated these issues remain
* Any Takers?
* Partnerships?
* Bueller?

# Acknowledgements

###This work was made possible with the support of the following individuals and organizations:
* Greg Ward, for like, everything (duh.)
* US Department of Energy, Buildings Technology Office (BTO)
* Jason DeGraw (NREL), for Windows build assistance
* Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari (Uni of Pennsylvania), for actually using OpenStudio's API
* Every one of my colleagues in the Commercial Buildings Research Group at NREL
* The Radiance community at large; you are all an inspiration to me

[In addition, several features of the Radiance Measure were developed for work under the Wells Fargo Innovation Incubator (IN^2) project.]
